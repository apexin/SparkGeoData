It would be interesting to see the median distance from request to POI. Since
the avg distance from POI to request is 400 km, the whole POI assignment
looks random wrt how this particular POI triggers the request generation.
To test this, I would want to see how density is affected on the different
length of radiuses, and see if there are more requests closer to the POI.
If the density increases as the raduis gets smaller, then something in the
close proximity of POI or POI itself possibly triggers request activity.
